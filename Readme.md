# VAIM Supplemental material

This code is supplied as supplementary material for the TVCG paper submission "Influence Maximization with Visual Analytics". To know more, please check the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LW3P4JCTDIM&t=4s).

Paper is published as gold open access, and is available on [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9829321).

The system is divided into two folders: client and server; the server folder also contains a sample database dump (containing sample graphs plus the graphs used in the case studies illustrated in the paper). Each folder contains a separate Readme file with building and running details.
