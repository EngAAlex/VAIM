# VAIM Supplemental material

This code is supplied as supplementary material for the TVCG paper submission "Influence Maximization with Visual Analytics". 

The system is divided into two folders: client and server; the server folder also contains a sample database dump (containing sample graphs plus the graphs used in the case studies illustrated in the paper). Each folder contains a separate Readme file with building and running details.

## Live Demo

A live demo of the system can be accessed [here](http://vaim.cvast.tuwien.ac.at).
